## Features

- Text classification of news articles into real or fake.
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for effective classification.
- Easy to use with a clear command line interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Flask**: For deploying the model as a web application (if applicable).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data). It consists of various news articles labeled as either "real" or "fake."
