## Features

- Text classification of news articles into real or fake.
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for effective classification.
- Easy to use with a clear command line interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Flask**: For deploying the model as a web application (if applicable).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Fake News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data). It consists of various news articles labeled as either "real" or "fake."

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavishagupta/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
To use this project:

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
**Model Training**: Train your machine learning model using the provided scripts.
**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with validation data.
**Prediction**: Predict whether a news article is real or fake using the trained model.
To run the application locally:

bash
python app.py

After running, you can access the application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
